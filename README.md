# infusion-nexus-gsheets
A Nexus adapter for Google Sheets

## step 0
 - [x] read from a spreadsheet
 - [x] config file defining aliases for sheets of interest, token location, credentials location
 - [ ] write something in the console and it is put in a cell in a spreadsheet
 - [ ] write something in the cell in the spreadsheet, and it is put in the console
 - [ ] output the csv in the console?

Do I depend on the nexus or not?
If I want to start the Nexus server from here, yes.
That means starting a kettle server that hosts a component tree which may be manipulated through the Nexus API.
the existing demos don't actually depend on the nexus? They just assume one will be started elsewhere
what is my ideal setup process?
open the demo, possibly open a google spreadsheet
